# Deployment - Intro

Deploying a **fastapi-mvc** project is relatively easy.

## What Does Deployment Mean

To **deploy** an application means to perform the necessary steps to make it **available to the users**.

For a **web API**, it normally involves putting it in a **remote machine**, with a **server program** that provides good performance, stability, etc, so that your **users** can **access** the application efficiently and without interruptions or problems.

This is in contrast to the **development** stages, where you are constantly changing the code, breaking it and fixing it, stopping and restarting the development server, etc.
